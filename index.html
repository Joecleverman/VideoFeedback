        1. Hi Sergio how is it going today? It’s been two weeks that we are
        working together now“ I appreciated the passion you brought to our work
        together — it’s clear you’re excited about the project. 2. “By the way,
        I noticed you weren’t in our last few morning meetings. I’m concerned
        that you may have missed some important information, and that it will be
        difficult for me to sync up with you. I’d like to take the time to go
        over what you missed now. Then, let’s work out a plan together so this
        doesn’t continue to happen in the future.” Is that ok for you?

        3. Hi London how is it going today? It’s been two weeks that we are
        working together now“I appreciated the passion you brought to our work
        together — it’s clear you’re excited about the project. I have to say
        that I learn a lot from you, but with time I find out that you rush
        through the curriculum too quickly. Therefore you don’t leave room for
        me to bring my ideas to the table. In particular, I noticed that you
        spoke over me several times throughout our meetings. Did you notice
        this, too? 4. “Moving forward, I’d like you to make space for me in
        conversations and meetings. It’s a necessary skill for my career
        development and helps utilize the full talents of the team. What do you
        think?”
